[AI Family House] üéØ
Basic Details:A **completely useless but entertaining** web application that simulates a digital family having conversations and playing games together. Think of it as a "digital dollhouse" where AI family members chat with each other in real-time! and a brother who can sing song from bottom to top in different voice

Project Description

Live Family Chat: An animated AI-powered house where unique family members have real-time, personality-driven conversations across rooms with speaking indicators.

üéØ Tile Counter Game: A quirky mini-game where users manually count floor tiles across rooms of increasing difficulty, earning points, speed bonuses, and achievements.

üé§ Music Room (Singing Brother): A fun music feature where typed song lyrics are sung in reverse line order using varied voices, with full control over pitch, speed.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Here are the ridiculous problems each of your features "solves":

1. **Live Family Chat**
   *Problem:* Real families don‚Äôt talk enough, especially when they‚Äôre fictional AI with distinct personalities spread across digital rooms.

2. **üéØ Tile Counter Game**
   *Problem:* People walk on tiles every day but tragically never count them ‚Äî we‚Äôre fixing the world‚Äôs most ignored numerical crisis.

3. **üé§ Music Room (Singing Brother)**
   *Problem:* Songs are always sung in the correct order ‚Äî what about the underappreciated art of *reverse karaoke chaos*?


The Solution (that nobody asked for)
1. **Live Family Chat**
   *Solution:* We built a virtual house full of AI family members who never stop talking ‚Äî finally, your dream of eavesdropping on a dysfunctional, digital household comes true. They chat, interrupt, gossip, and overshare... all without asking how your day was.

2. **üéØ Tile Counter Game**
   *Solution:* We turned floor tiles into a competitive sport. Armed with + and ‚Äì buttons, you‚Äôll count your way to glory, one room at a time. Because who needs Call of Duty when you have ceramic math warfare?

3. **üé§ Music Room (Singing Brother)**
   *Solution:* We flipped your lyrics, gave each line its own bizarre voice, and let our singing brother belt them out backwards. It's like karaoke night... if reality were slightly broken and way more fun.
